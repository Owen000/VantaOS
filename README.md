# VantaOS
# Ok some more news, I am completely rewriting everything and following instructions from https://wiki.osdev.org/
just me messing around with low-level code. Hopefully I will have a functioning OS.
What I am working on right now.

#1 Boot Loader

#2 Kernel

Most of this code isn't mine and is from different sites. I am just working on figuring it all out and am making progress.
